# raPID: Rafaels PID flight controller

Not that versatile as of now. If I keep working on it, I plan to add rate/stabilize mode[done], arbitrary flight modes (different PID settings and offsets) and flight mode interpolation (otherwise called transitional mixers) to smoothly switch between any two flight modes.

Adjusting the settings should be done via bluetooth and a desktop application/website (have not thought about that part yet... far off)
